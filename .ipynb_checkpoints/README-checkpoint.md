## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{As students we enjoy listening to music, whether it be in the car, studying for midterms or a dance party with friends. Our dataset consists of Spotify music tracks from the 2000s decade along with various categories to determine if the song is considered a ‘hit’. The dataset can then be used to predict if a new track will become a ‘hit’ or not. If a song is classified as a ‘flop’ it means the track will most likely not be considered popular in the mainstream of Spotify. Over the course of the semester we hope to generate an algorithm that will allow people to determine which categories contribute to the success of a track becoming a ‘hit’. Also, we want to understand which categories have the greatest impact on whether a track is predicted to hit the Hot-100 tracks in it’s decade. Specifically we are interested in how relevant the danceability, tempo and time signature are to the success of the track. We think this dataset will allow us to build a user-facing Dashboard. The Dashboard will highlight the categories that lead artist’s to produce a ‘hot’ track in comparison to categories that cause an artist’s track to ‘flop’.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The data that we chose is provided by a user on Kaggle. This dataset basically describes information of a track like its artist and name, some features of the track like danceability, rank for times indicates how many times the track is played and whether the track is hit or flop. It is collected in 2020 according to Kaggle. The reason why the user collects this data is that he wants to use this data to make a classification model in order to predict if a new track would be popular or not. Although this data is provided by a person, he just made some summary using Python. The raw data which is historical records digitized comes from Spotify and Billboard and all data comes from Spotify’s Web API.}
