## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{As students, we enjoy listening to music whether it be in the car, studying for midterms, or at a dance party with friends. Our dataset consists of Spotify music tracks from the 2000s along with various attributes used to determine if the song can be considered a ‘hit’. If a song is classified as a ‘flop’ because of the relevant attributes of the track, it won't likely be considered popular in the mainstream of Spotify. Over the course of the semester we hope to generate an algorithm that will allow people to determine which attribute values contribute to the likelihood of a track becoming a ‘hit’. Also, we want to understand which attributes have the greatest impact on whether a track is predicted to hit the Hot-100 tracks in the '00s' decade. Specifically we are interested in how relevant the danceability, tempo, and time signatures are to the success of the track. We think this dataset will allow us to build a user-facing dashboard. The dashboard will allow comparisons between the categories that lead artist’s to produce a ‘hot’ track and those that cause an artist’s track to ‘flop’. Note that the 'hit' and 'flop' criteria are True/False variables in our dataset.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The data that we chose is provided by a user on Kaggle. This dataset describes information of a track like the artist and track name, as well as some features of the track like danceability, loudness, and key. There is a category that states if the track is a hit or flop, the details of this distinction can be found in the raw data's README. It is collected in 2020 according to Kaggle. The user collected this data to make a song classification model to predict if a new track would be popular or not. The person who made this summary of the data used Python and collected the raw data (digitized historical records) from Spotify's and Billboard's Web API.}
